It took a while but HP´s response to Cisco´s Meraki has hit the market. Say welcome to HP Cloud Network Manager!
So far it looks like a joint-venture with Aruba who already has a cloud solution on the market, just with a HP twist to it.

HP is launching with three AP models each targeted at a specific price range:

As of now there isn´t that much information to come by, and it´s unclear what long-term goals HP has for this solution. But stay tuned for more information as it arrives from HP.
