<p>Good news! Prime Infrastructure 2.1 is out and available.  But instead of getting a upgrade path from 1.4 we only get a 2.0 -&gt; 2.1 upgrade. It seems that all that was promised in the 2.1 upgrade the last 6 months are postponed to 2.2. So no new LMS features, and were still waiting on the 7.6x wlc features.</p>
<p>I´ll be honest that i´m not the biggest fan of Prime. Too many bugs, slow feature turnaround. I´m personally prone to lean towards Solarwinds and HP´s IMC for many tasks, but Cisco´s getting there. If they hold true to their promise and deliver feature parity with LMS in 2015 and get rid of their stupid license department, they´ll have a kille product. But that´s many if´s...</p>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support for the new Catalyst 3650.</li>
<li>Support for all the new 802.11ac AP´s (3700, 2700 etc...).</li>
<li>AVC gets some UI improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the release notes <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/prime/infrastructure/2-1/release/notes/cpi_rn.html#pgfId-44030" target="_blank">here...</a></p>
<p>I just wish that they would do something about the 15+ min. boot time and service restart. It´s a killer !</p>
