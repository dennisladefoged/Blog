My blog has been dead for some time now. Mostly due to having two hyper-active kids and everything that follows with having a family.
But I recently got the chance to start as a Systems Engineer at Aruba Networks here in Denmark. So I have decided to start blogging again about my new employment and the things that come with working for a vendor.</p>
More to come :-)
