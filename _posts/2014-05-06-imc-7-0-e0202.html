<p>Since my change to HP networking, I´ve been working steadily on gaining experience on every aspect of HP networking products. One product in particular is HP´s IMC which is their solution to network management. In the past I have solely worked on Solarwinds and hold a SCP. But i´m pretty impressed with IMC and the roadmap that HP is showing. So far they have been able to stick to a 6 month update turnaround, which have shown good progress. Now with the latest version E0202 they have bumped IMC upwards with some enhancements and lots of bugfixes.
